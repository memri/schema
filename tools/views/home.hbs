  This is the Schema used by Memri, dictating how information is stored in the database on your Pod.
</p>

<h4>Item hierarchy</h4>
<p>
  The <a href="/thing">Item hierarchy</a> defines what types of Items can exist in the database, what Properties and
  Edges they can have, and how the Items are related. As the database is a graph database, Items can be be seen as nodes
  in the graph. The Items are in a hierarchy to enable smart retrieval. For instance, to find all <i>ImageObjects</i>
  and <i>VideoObjects</i> related to some Item, we can query them using their parent Item type <i>MediaObject</i>.
</p>

<h4>Edge &#38; Property hierarchy</h4>
<p>
  The <a href="/predicate">Edge and Property hierarchy</a> defines what Edges and Properties can exist in the database,
  what type of data they refer to, and how the Edges and Properties are related. The expected types of properties are
  primitive data types, like strings and ints, and are always one-to-one relations. Edges point to other Items, and are
  one-to-many relations. Again, we use an hierarchy to enable smart retrieval. For instance, to find all family members
  of an item of type <i>Person</i>, all Edges that are of the <i>familyRelation</i>-type can be queried, retrieving all
  its children in the Edge and Property hierarchy, including <i>mothers</i>, <i>fathers</i>, <i>sisters</i>, etc.
